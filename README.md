# About me.

Hello! My name is Alexander and I am a novice iOS developer. I became interested in programming back in school, when I was shown Pascal and Scratch in a computer science lesson, a program in which I could create algorithms for playing animations on the main screen using ready-made code blocks.

Currently, I have embarked on the path of iOS development, studying Architectures and UI, and writing my first applications. I participate in SWIFT marathons and actively attend Coffee meetings.&The code in Ryazan. 

In creating applications, I like the fact that you work with the object of your labor from scratch: you write code, develop its architecture, create the appearance and animation.

Nice to meet you!
